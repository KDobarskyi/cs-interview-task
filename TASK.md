# DNS IP Aliasing Proxy - Rapid Prototyping Challenge

## Overview

**Time Limit:** 45 minutes  
**Challenge Type:** Rapid Prototyping  

## Objectives

Implement a complete system consisting of:

1. **DNS IP Aliasing Proxy** - A proxy server that handles DNS resolution and IP aliasing
2. **Live UI** - A user interface to interact with and monitor the proxy

## Requirements

### 1. DNS IP Aliasing Proxy

Implement a proxy server that:
- Intercepts DNS requests
- Provides IP aliasing functionality
- Handles DNS resolution
- Routes traffic appropriately

### 2. Live UI

Create a user interface that:
- Provides real-time interaction with the proxy
- Shows live status/monitoring
- Allows configuration of aliases
- Displays proxy activity

## Technical Specifications

- Choose appropriate technology stack
- Ensure both components work together
- Focus on rapid prototyping approach
- Prioritize functionality over polish

## Deliverables

1. Working DNS IP Aliasing Proxy
2. Functional Live UI
3. Basic documentation of how to run the system

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Functionality:** Does the system work as intended?
- **Integration:** Do the proxy and UI work together?
- **Code Quality:** Clean, readable implementation
- **Time Management:** Completed within 45-minute constraint
